ASSIGNMENT#1: JavaScript + HTML + CSS

Based on your previous works,  "Your CAFE" sells a variety of ice cream flavours such as cherry, strawberry, mulberry, grapes, etc. (you can add more flavours). The price for a cup of ice cream is given below:

Cherry - RM7.50; Strawberry - RM5.55;  Mulberry -RM4.25; Grapes -RM6.55; etc - the price is up to you to sell. 

For a special day like Friday, all flavours are selling at RM3.50. 30% discount will be given to customers buying more than RM30. You as a programmer using Javascript, HTML and CSS are required to produce a receipt of buying for all customers. Be creative to design a website for "Your Cafe" and will able to produce a receipt of buying of certain days.
